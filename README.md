<li>Consistent header and footer across all pages.</li>
<li>Officer profiles</li>
<li>Photos to be added. Free, public domain, or taken by yourself. No color scheme to comply to (yet)</li>
<li>Layout sanity check by not-mark</li>
<li>Graphic styling. Lower priority, still would be nice but not crucial</li>
