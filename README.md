<h2> State of the Project </h2>
<h3> 9/3//15 - Mark McGivern</h3>
It's out in the world, can be linked to, and spread around. While the wants are option, we really only need content updates every meeting or so.
<h3> What do we need? </h3>
<ul>
<li>Work for Featured Works page</li>
<li>Meeting content created each meeting</li>
</ul>
<h3> What do we want? (in descending priority)</h3>
<ul>
<li>format images for low bandwidth usage in GIMP</li>
<li>Graphic styling. Lower priority, still would be nice but not crucial</li>
<li>Form on contact page</li>
<li>Last priority: database</li>
</ul>

Planned features: <ul>
